   <h2>Ingredients</h2>
   <ul>

      <li>1 pound cod, halibut, or catfish filets, thawed if frozen</li>
      <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
      <li>1/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</li>
      <li>1 cup panko bread crumbs</li>
      <li>2 teaspoons Old Bay seasoning</li>
      <li>1 large egg</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon water</li>
      <li>1/3 cup flour</li>
      <li>cooking spray</li>
      <li>1 lemon, cut into wedges</li>
      
   </ul>

   <h2>Steps needed for making the dish</h2>
   <ol>
      <li>Gather all ingredients.</li>

      <li>Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper or use a silicone baking mat.</li>

      <li>Blot fish dry with paper towels. Season fish with salt and pepper. Cut filets crosswise in 1-inch strips.</li>

      <li>Combine panko and Old Bay seasoning in a shallow dish. Beat together egg and water in a second shallow dish. Place flour in a third shallow dish.</li>

      <li>Dip fish pieces in flour to coat, shaking off excess, then in egg mixture, then in panko. Place breaded fish sticks on the prepared baking sheet.</li>

      <li>Coat fish sticks generously with cooking spray. Bake freshly breaded or frozen fish sticks until golden brown, 18 to 20 minutes, turning once halfway through baking time.</li>

      <li>For Tartar Sauce, in a small bowl whisk together mayonnaise, pickle relish, onion, dill weed, capers (if using), and lemon juice. Chill at least 2 hours before serving and up to 1 week.</li>

      <li>Serve fish sticks with Tartar Sauce and lemon wedges.</li>
